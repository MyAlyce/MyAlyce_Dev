### UX/UI

- styling
- break down device charts, only have the ones toggle on for the sensors that are detected
- webrtc ux/ui. Make calling yourself its own separate deal from calling other users (since its just setting up a remote connection for yourself)
- fix or replace the top bar, the embedded menu doesn't work anymore so it's covered with a placeholder burger menu

### Scripting/Events/State

- finish file saving subscriptions with local/stream recording
- readd basic alert workflow
- readd saved browser state
- webrtc management, test video and audio
- readd notifications, friends lists, etc.

### Backend

- Security


### Fix

- address bar state when rerouting to dashboard and it still says /peers etc
