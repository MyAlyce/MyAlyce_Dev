### UX/UI
- styling
- break down device charts, only have the ones toggle on for the sensors that are detected
- webrtc ux/ui. Make calling yourself its own separate deal from calling other users (since its just setting up a remote connection for yourself)

### Scripting/Events/State

- finish file saving subscriptions with local/stream recording. Get google drive working somehow
- readd basic alert workflow
- readd saved browser state
- webrtc management, test video and audio
- readd notifications, friends lists, etc.

### Backend

- Security
- plain email/password storage? i.e. not just google reliance
